Project Name: Lending Club Case Study

Problem statement:
Banks are lending loans to their existing customer or new customers. Before sanctioning a loan to any customer, Banks are supposed to check the risk involved in sanctioning loan to a customer/borrower. It is important to check whether the customer can repay the loan as per schedule without any default. Default of loan payment will be loss to the Banks. At the same time, if loans are not sanctioned to many customers considering the risks, Banks will lose business. Banks need to have mechanism to identify customers/borrowers who are likely to default

Scope of study:
This case study is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate

Approach:
The case study will be approached through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) method which consists of the following steps
•	Data sourcing
•	Data cleaning to make the data are suitable for analysis and appropriate to arrive at correct inference/conclusion
•	Performing Univariate analysis considering individual variables and providing meaningful inference on loan acceptance/rejection
•	Performing bivariate analysis to understand effect one variable on another variable and providing meaningful inference on loan       acceptance/ rejection
•	Performing the analysis using derived metrics where applicable and providing useful inference on loan

1. Data sourcing:
Data are provided in the file “loan.csv”. No additional details are expected to be analysed as part of the case study. This data are considered to be private data as they are from Bank.

2. Data Cleaning:
•	Deleting columns having null values or columns  with same value across entire dataset
•	Removing columns whose data will not give any useful information for analysis
•	Removing outliers that are very much away from median
•	Imputing missing values or removing them in such a way that they do not alter final analysis result
•	Deriving data or converting available data to required format
•	Standardization of values

3. Analysis:
•	Analyzing distribution of data based on one variable and multi-variables
•	Analyzing derived metrics to infer additional insight from the data
•	Visualization of analysis outcome through plot

4. Recommendation:
•	Recommendations based on the analysis along with analysis details are provided in the report "Lending_Club_Case_study_Report.pdf"
